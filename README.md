## 2. Apps <a name="apps"></a>

### 2.1 Synesthesia App <a name="synesthesia-app"></a> (Location: Synesthesia)

##### 2.1.1 Overview

The Synesthesia modding tool integrates the Chroma DLL enabled games with various Razer Sensa haptic devices to provide a synchronized gaming experience that involves dynamic haptic feedback based on in-game events (Chroma animations). The DevKit contains an example of the Hogwarts Legacy haptic integration. A complete documentation on Synesthesia can be found at this link: https://www.interhaptics.com/doc/chroma-sensa/#synesthesia 

The Synesthesia apps can be found in the folders `Release`, and `ReleaseConsole`.

- `Release\`: folder containing release candidate version of Synesthesia (no window/background process)
- `ReleasewithConsole\`: folder containing console version of Synesthesia. This version is able to automatically create a Haptic Folder just by listening to a Chroma Sensa enabled appâ€™s external messages.

##### 2.1. Example: Hogwarts Legacy

- Install the Steam version of Hogwarts Legacy.
- Plug in the Razer Sensa haptic devices.
- Open Synapse and uncheck `ENABLE THIS APP` from the `CONNECT'->'APPS' section.

- Launch the Synesthesia app from the Synesthesia/ReleaseConsole folder (as Administrator). The Hogwarts Legacy haptic files are already inside the package and will intercept the Chroma Events sent by the game to play the corresponding haptics. The following messages can be seen on the Synesthesia with Console app.

- Launch the Hogwarts Legacy game.
- Stupefy!

### 2.2. Tech Demo <a name="tech-demo"></a> (Location: TechDemo)
- Stop Synesthesia if it is already running. (If Synesthesia.exe was opened before, use the SynesthesiaStop.exe. If running SynesthesiaConsole, close it.)
- Decompress the file TechDemo_V[x.x.x].zip in a folder of your choice.
- Plug the custom firmware Kraken and the Kishi Ultra game controller in USB ports. For the Kraken check that the haptics button situated on the bottom right cup is on and at the right intensity for you (it has an off sound and 3 possible intensities from low to high).
- Launch the TechDemo app from inside the unarchived folder.
- Before pressing play, you can set the intensity of Haptics, Audio, or add a haptic delay.
- Press Play and enjoy the Razer Sensa Tech Demo.
